# PLAYLISTER

Playlister creates a playlist of your favourite youtube videos. At first, we planned the Playlister to be a "music" only listing. Meaning, taking only the audio of the youtube video, but due to Youtube Data restricting laws, that was changed. Now its just save video on the playlists.

# USAGE

1. Search on the search bar the video you want.
2. Click the Add button to add the video on playlist
3. Enjoy!
